# AMM Configuration Data Model

## Overview
In order to simulate a scenario, modules capable of performing the desired simulation must be present and properly
 configured.
In order for a given Scenario definition to be simulated on a variety of hardware,
 common definitions of module functionality, requirements and configuration must be established.
This document outlines the format for these definitions.

## Capabilities
Capabilities are the logical Unit of Functionality for a given module.
Each distinct function of a module should be broken into a separate Capability where possible.
This not only clearly defines what all a module is capable of,
 but also enables functionality to be configured and monitored independently,
 providing better resilience for modules designed and built this way. 
Module technical definition and configuration is broken down by Capability,
 and modules report their status on a per-Capability basis.

When possible, manufacturers shall use existing Capability descriptions to denote functionality and configuration
 within their modules.
This greatly enhances interoperability and enables re-use of scenario definitions.

Definitions for capabilities are in the [Capability Types Glossary](glossaries/Capability).

## AMM Standard Version
Derived from [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org), AMM uses the version numbering scheme: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Version numbers are incremented based on the following:
* MAJOR Version: Changes to IDL / XML Schema, breaking changes to Glossary definitions
* MINOR Version: New entries added to Glossaries
* PATCH Version: Non-breaking changes to Glossary definitions, bug fixes

Development / beta versions may break this, but will have a Major version of `0`. Once `v1.0.0` is published,
 this will be in effect.

## Operational Description
All Modules musts publish their Capabilities using the `OperationalDescription` Topic.
The Topic consists of several metadata fields about the module, along with the `capabilities_schema` field,
 which is an XML document describing the Capabilities and configuration options for the Module.
 
`OperationDescription` Topic fields:
* Name (human friendly)
* Description (1 paragraph)
* Manufacturer
* Model
* Serial Number
* Module ID (UUID, DDS Topic Key)
* Module Version
* AMM Standard Version
* Capabilities Schema ([XML Schema Definition](schema/CapabilitiesSchema.xsd), more details below)


#### `module_id` Field
This is generated by the Module and must be unique per module instance.

#### `capabilities_schema` Field
This field shall comply with the [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema) (version 1.1) defined by
 [CapabilitiesSchema.xsd](schema/CapabilitiesSchema.xsd).
